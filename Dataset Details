There were two separate dataset named as True.csv and Fake.csv and I merged then in single file.
Each csv file has 4 columns title, text, subject and date.
Date and subjects were not necessasry so I removed them and added a new feature named label.

True.csv file has 21417 and Fake.csv file has 23502 including duplicates and null values.
Fake.csv has 17903 unique values and True.csv has 20826 unique values.
