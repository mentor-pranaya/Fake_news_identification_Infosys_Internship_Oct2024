# Fake_news_identification_Infosys_Internship_Oct2024

# Project Statement:
 Thanks to the digital era, any news can spread world-wide within fraction of seconds. But, are the things we read
on the sites always accurate? This news is sometimes fraudulent, and the terrible aspect is that many people believe
them and even follow them, which has led to some dangerous outcomes. AI is being used by companies such as
Facebook, Google, and others to detect and remove false news from their platforms. The goal is to identify the fake
news by glancing at the text.

# Outcomes:
Perform text denoising on the text corpus.
Identify the text as fishy or not using neural nets.

# Modules to be implemented
1. Data Collection â€“ Text Corpus related to news articles
2. Data Exploration (EDA) and Data Preprocessing
3. Build a deep learning model
4. Hyperparameter tuning
5. Performance metrics
6. Presentation and Documentation
