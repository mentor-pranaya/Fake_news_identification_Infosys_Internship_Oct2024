### The Fake News Detection Application based on Deep Learning ###

Step 1: Downloaded the Dataset csv from Kaggle an open source platform.
-link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets
-features: Dataset contains two csv file one is true and one is with fake news.
-columns: each csv file consist four columns that are: title, text, subject, and date.

Step 2: Setup the IDE to perform EDA on dataset.
-Create the environment as IDE with Google Colab to load the dataset and further processing like EDA.

Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.
-Labelled both of the Datasets as value=1 for True news and value=2 for Fake news.
-Concatenate both of the Datasets as df to get the Master Dataset.
-Import Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries of Python to visualize the Data.
-Searched for the missing values in the Dataset.
-Drop the unnecessary columns from the Dataset like 'title' and 'date'.
-Removed the duplicated values from the dataset.
-Performed the text preprocesing with importing nltk and stopwords.
-Lastly checked the dataset whether balanced or not.

Step 3: Exploring Deep Learning model.
